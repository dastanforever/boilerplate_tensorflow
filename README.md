# Tensorflow Boilerplate

Most of the structure and ideas are taken from assignments of Stanford course [CS224N](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/). This is a basic structure to write tensorflow programs.

## Usage
Just fill in the main.py and remember to check out utils.py for some helpful functions. To run the model, use 

**``python main.py``**
